# Habitualize

## In Progress 🚧

### Habitualize is a habit tracker app 🤯

This is a simple yet powerful habit tracker, designed to help users manage and track their daily habits. The app is currently under development with a Flask backend and a ReactJS frontend.

## How to Set It Up

--

### Backend (Flask) Setup

#### Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the required dependencies

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Flask server

```bash
    python app.py
```

The backend will now be running on [127.0.0.1:500](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Ensure the terminal you're in is in the backend folder location.

### Frontend (ReactJS) Setup

On a SEPARATE terminal, Navigate to the **frontend folder** and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
    npm install
```

Start the React development server:

```bash
    npm start
```

Ensure the terminal you're in is in the frontend folder location.

- Run these in different terminals

The frontend will now be running on http://[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
